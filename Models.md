- Air cooler with Fan makes less noise compared to Blower type cooler. 
- And also clean the cooler’s fan blades and also inside the cooler (Ex: Water tank) at least once in a month so that dust won't get deposited and make more noise.
- Based on the materials used in their fabrication, cooling pads are manufactured in two varieties, the ones made out of a) Cellulose, and b) Wood Wool
- A great advantage of honeycomb cooling pads arises from the fact that apart from providing potent cooling, they also tend to dampen shakes and vibrations arising out of the air cooler when it is in use, thereby reducing noise. On the flip side, these tend to be slightly pricey and typically cost thrice as the ones made out of wood wool.
- As a general observation, for most homes, an air cooler having power rating between 130–230W makes for a wise purchase. Power rating any lesser than 130W would lead to ineffective cooling of space, leading the users to feel warm and uneasy, though energy consumption would be minimal.
- An air cooler serves the sweet spot between the comfort provided by a regular ceiling fan and a heavy duty air conditioner, both in terms of initial cost as well as recurring expenditure in the name of electricity bills. Hence, it is one of the most sought after home appliances.

- use of BLDC motors
    - BLDC motors are more energy efficient compared to 1 phase induction motor
    - absence of slip rings (which gets wear out over time) reduces friction, electrical resistance, heat during operation thus reduces a point of failure 
    - no need for starter capacitor which is most common point of failure in 1 phase induction motors
    - speed can be more dynamically controlled from 0% to 100% (unlike in conventional cooler where there are 3 speed levels based on winding ratio)
    - BLDC motors operate more quitely than conventional motor reducing motor noise
    - BLDC motor is available significantly small form factor for similar torque requirements. thus dry weight of cooler can be also reduced.
    - BLDC motors can easily reach very high RPMs so there is scope to operate with smaller diameter propellers (translating to smaller size unit) maintaining same or more airflow than conventional unit
