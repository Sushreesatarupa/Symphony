- Air cooler with Fan makes less noise compared to Blower type cooler. 
- And also clean the coolerâ€™s fan blades and also inside the cooler (Ex: Water tank) at least once in a month so that dust won't get deposited and make more noise.
- Based on the materials used in their fabrication, cooling pads are manufactured in two varieties, the ones made out of a) Cellulose, and b) Wood Wool
- A great advantage of honeycomb cooling pads arises from the fact that apart from providing potent cooling, they also tend to dampen shakes and vibrations arising out of the air cooler when it is in use, thereby reducing noise. On the flip side, these tend to be slightly pricey and typically cost thrice as the ones made out of wood wool.
