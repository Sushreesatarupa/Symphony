- An air cooler works on the principle of imparting chill to the air by evaporation of water. 
- Due to this fact, air coolers are also known by the name 'evaporative coolers' in some places. 
- Evaporative cooling is based on the fact that water absorbs a large amount of heat in order to evaporate. 
- The temperature of air drops significantly when phase transition of water from liquid to vapour state takes place.
- This method of cooling the air takes much less energy than the principle of refrigeration used in air conditioners. 
- Lesser energy consumption translates into lesser electricity bills, thus higher savings. 
- In dry climates, evaporative cooling also provides an additional advantage of enhancing the moisture content of air, thereby providing added benefits to the consumers.
- Hot air from the surroundings is pulled inside the air cooler where it passes through moistened pads. 
- A water tank situated at the bottom of the air cooler provides continuous supply of water to the pads. 
- An electric pump fitted inside the air cooler is responsible for taking streams of water from the water tank up towards the cooling pads and moistening them. 
- The moist pads absorb heat from the air which results in evaporation of moisture from the cooling pads, thereby cooling the air by as much as 8 - 12 degree celcius and enhancing its moisture content. 
- The cool and moistened air is then recirculated by the means of a fan driven by an electric motor into the environment which lowers down the surrounding temperatures and provides comfort to those nearby.

- Air coolers are primarily manufactured in three configurations:-
    - Personal Air Coolers
    - Desert/Window Air Coolers
    - Tower Air Coolers
- Personal Air Coolers
As the name suggests, personal air coolers are mobile air cooling appliances that can effectively cool areas up to 200 square feet and can be moved to any location within oneâ€™s house as per requirement. Due to the relatively smaller area personal air coolers can cater to, they are best suited for bedrooms and/or medium sized living rooms. Castor wheels are attached to the bottom of the frame of the air cooler which help to increase the maneuverability quotient of personal air coolers and thus make them very versatile devices ready for being put to use right out of the box. Due to their small form factor, personal air coolers have a limited capacity water storage tank, so in some cases, one might find the need to refill the tank twice a day.

Desert/Window Air Coolers
This category of air coolers is very popular among buyers for the fact that its cooling prowess is not limited to just one bedroom or a small living room, but to areas in excess of 550 square feet. Therefore, just one desert air cooler is sufficient enough to adequately cool a major section of oneâ€™s home. Desert air coolers are also known by the name â€˜Window air coolersâ€™ for their place of installation being a window, just like that of window air conditioners. Unlike personal air coolers, desert air coolers need to be installed by a skilled technician filling the gaps and crevices by a suitable material created as a result of removal of glass pane from the window and installation of the air cooler in its place.

Tower Air Coolers
Tower air coolers are by and large quite similar to personal air coolers both in terms of maneuverability as well as the effective area they can efficiently cool, but with the added benefit of an even smaller form factor and a more aesthetically pleasing form factor as compared to personal air coolers. Since tower air coolers are more tall than wide, they take even lesser space on ground than personal air coolers making them an ideal choice for homes where space is a little constrained.

Now, having learnt about the three types of air coolers along with the effective area each of them can efficiently cool, let us proceed to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of air coolers.
