- An air cooler works on the principle of imparting chill to the air by evaporation of water. 
- Due to this fact, air coolers are also known by the name 'evaporative coolers' in some places. 
- Evaporative cooling is based on the fact that water absorbs a large amount of heat to evaporate. 
- The temperature of airdrops significantly when phase transition of water from liquid to vapor state takes place.
- This method of cooling the air takes much less energy than the principle of refrigeration used in air conditioners. 
- Lesser energy consumption translates into lesser electricity bills, thus higher savings. 
- In dry climates, evaporative cooling also provides an additional advantage of enhancing the moisture content of air, thereby providing added benefits to the consumers.
- Hot air from the surroundings is pulled inside the air cooler, passing through moistened pads. 
- A water tank situated at the bottom of the air cooler provides a continuous water supply to the pads. 
- An electric pump fitted inside the air cooler is responsible for taking streams of water from the water tank up towards the cooling pads and moistening them. 
- The moist pads absorb heat from the air, which results in moisture evaporation from the cooling pads, thereby cooling the atmosphere by as much as 8 - 12 degrees Celcius and enhancing its moisture content. 
- The cool and moistened air is then recirculated using a fan driven by an electric motor into the environment, which lowers the surrounding temperatures and provides comfort to those nearby.

- Air coolers are primarily manufactured in three configurations:-
    - Personal Air Coolers
    - Desert/Window Air Coolers
    - Tower Air Coolers
- Personal Air Coolers
    - As the name suggests, personal air coolers are mobile air cooling appliances that can effectively cool areas up to 200 square feet and can be moved to any location within one's house as per requirement. 
    - Due to the relatively smaller area personal air coolers can cater to, they are best suited for bedrooms and/or medium-sized living rooms. 
    - Castor wheels are attached to the bottom of the frame of the air cooler, which helps to increase the maneuverability quotient of personal air coolers and thus make them very versatile devices ready for being put to use right out of the box. 
    - Due to their small form factor, personal air coolers have a limited capacity water storage tank, so in some cases, one might find the need to refill the tank twice a day.

- Desert/Window Air Coolers
    - This category of air coolers is trendy among buyers because its cooling prowess is not limited to just one bedroom or a small living room but to areas over 550 square feet. 
    - Therefore, just one desert air cooler is sufficient to adequately cool a significant section of one's home. 
    - Desert air coolers are also known by the name 'Window air coolers' for their place of installation being a window, just like that of window air conditioners. 
    - Unlike personal air coolers, desert air coolers need to be installed by a skilled technician filling the gaps and crevices with a suitable material created as a result of removing the glass pane from the window and installing the air cooler in its place.


- Tower Air Coolers
    - Tower air coolers are by and large quite similar to personal air coolers in terms of maneuverability and the effective area they can efficiently cool, but with the added benefit of an even smaller form factor and a more aesthetically pleasing form factor as compared to personal air coolers. 
    - Since tower air coolers are more tall than wide, they take even lesser space on the ground than personal air coolers making them an ideal choice for homes where space is a little constrained.

# PROS:-
- Low energy consumption. A typical 1.5-ton window air conditioner with a 5-star energy rating consumes approximately 1.4 - 1.8 units of electricity per hour. At the same time, a desert cooler consumes a measly 0.2 - 0.5 units of electricity per hour. Assuming both the appliances run for 8 hours a day, one would be able to reduce the energy consumption by about 40 percent, which would result in significantly lesser electricity bills.
- Little to no maintenance. Apart from the annual replacement of cooling pads, which are relatively inexpensive, air coolers do not require any other kind of maintenance. Hence, unlike air conditioners which need to be thoroughly cleaned each season before they can be brought into operation, air coolers can be brought into use as per one's wish by only having installed a fresh set of cooling pads.
- Dual-purpose. Since air coolers work on the principle of evaporative cooling, the phenomenon entails that moisture and humidity levels of the surrounding air are also enhanced apart from cooling the area. The results are somewhat comparable to the cool-moisture rich breeze one would feel standing beside a waterfall. Therefore, predominantly dry regions, where the surrounding air has little moisture content, would benefit significantly from the dual characteristics of air coolers. Even in coastal and other relatively humid areas, air coolers make a great proposition in the months preceding rainfall.
- No use of refrigerants. Unlike air conditioners that rely on refrigerants like Hydro-Chloro-Fluoro-Carbon (HCFC) or Hydro-Fluoro-Carbon (HFC) to provide necessary cooling, with air coolers, it's just air and water. Those sophisticated odorless refrigerants that find their application in air conditioners upon accidental leak might prove to be harmful to humans if inhaled. Additionally, refrigerant leaks are a significant cause of ozone layer depletion and global warming in general.

# CONS:-
- A little noisy. Since air coolers use a fan/blower to throw a cool breeze of air into the room, the functioning of a moving fan is often not pleasing to the ears. Additionally, other components of the air cooler such as the electric motor and the electric pump also contribute their bit to the already noisy environment; however, with time, one gets used to the sounds, but those who prefer to have an utmost peaceful home environment might not find air coolers to their liking. In such cases, air conditioners make for a better alternative since they offer a quieter and often noiseless operation.
- Not very effective in humid conditions. As stated before, air coolers work best when surrounding air is dry. Typically, the humidity level up to which air coolers are most effective is below 65 percent. If the humidity level is higher than it, the additional moisture created by the air cooler would only add to the uneasiness and overall discomfort in breathing. In such a scenario, using an air conditioner may prove to be the only source of respite.
- Continual monitoring of water level. As the entire operation of air coolers relies on water availability in the storage tank, one has to replenish the water in the tank periodically. Furthermore, loading water in the tank is itself a chore as one has to unload several buckets of water depending upon the water tank capacity or connect a hosepipe to the inlet port of the water tank, then keep a watch on the water level and disconnect the hosepipe before the tank overflows. Given the same, if one is more inclined towards a hassle-free appliance that does not require frequent monitoring again, an air conditioner makes for a wiser choice.

So, having analyzed the Pros and Cons of owning an air cooler, let us proceed to examine some of the essential aspects of air coolers that one should keep in consideration before buying one:-

# IMPORTANT POINTS TO CONSIDER
- Power rating. 
    - For most homes, an air cooler with a power rating between 130 - 230 W would make for an ideal choice. 
    - A power rating lesser than 130 W would result in relatively more minor cooling, and greater than 230 W would ensure excellent cooling but would entail higher energy consumption, resulting in higher than expected electricity bills. 
    - Therefore, power rating between the mentioned range would ensure a perfect balance between effective cooling and energy efficiency.
- Types of cooling pads. 
    - Primarily, cooling pads of air coolers can be made from two materials - Cellulose or Wood shavings/synthetic fiber. 
    - The cooling pads that make use of cellulose have an appearance as that of honeycomb and are named 'honeycomb cooling pads. 
    - This category of cooling pads is highly durable and efficient, and in most cases, requires replacement only once in two seasons. 
    - However, these are costly in nature, typically thrice as expensive as the second type of cooling pads called 'aspen/wood wool cooling pads. 
    - Aspen cooling pads have an appearance as dried grass and have a texture like that of wood shavings. 
    - These cooling pads are relatively less efficient than honeycomb ones but are very economical. 
    - As a result, air coolers that use aspen cooling pads are relatively less pricey as well.

Some manufacturers (names not taken) try to cut manufacturing costs to maximize profits and deliver a sub-standard product to the customers. The components have a concise shelf life and may require frequent repairs/replacements.

# COST CUTTING TECHNIQUES
- Low-grade overheating electric motor. The electric motor rotates at high RPMs to power the blower/fan that throws cool moistened air into the surroundings. It makes the electric motor one of the most crucial components of the air cooler and therefore accounts for almost 30 percent of the entire cost of the product. Hence, it is one of the favorite areas of some manufacturers to cut costs and increase their profit margins. Some manufacturers resort to using a below-par electric motor that is not powerful enough to keep the fan rotating at high speeds for long periods. After only a few minutes of use, these electric motors tend to get extremely hot. As you might be aware, metals expand on heating, which causes the copper windings in the engine to initially distort and then finally melt, thereby leaving the air cooler unit out of operation. The cost of repairing the motor might range from a few hundred bucks to more than a thousand bucks, and this process is recurring.
- Inefficient cooling pads. The cooling performance of an air cooler is a result of the material used in manufacturing the cooling pads and their thickness. As a rule of thumb, cooling pads having a thickness greater than 85 mm are most effective in sufficiently cooling the space. Thicker cooling pads also last longer than their thinner counterparts and require less frequent replacement. However, thicker cooling pads are a little costly, so to cut production costs and to reduce the overall cost of the product, some manufacturers resort to using thinner, poorly fabricated cooling pads, the cooling prowess of which is inadequate, which often results in leaving the users feeling uncomfortable and uneasy despite the air cooler being in operation for a long time.
